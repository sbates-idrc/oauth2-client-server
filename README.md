OAuth 2 Client and Server example
=================================

Written as a learning exercise. Uses [OAuth2orize](https://github.com/jaredhanson/oauth2orize) with [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Passport](http://passportjs.org/).

Start the server and client web apps with:

* `node server.js`
* `node client.js`

The server runs on port 3000 and the client runs on port 3001.

Point your browser to: http://localhost:3001/
